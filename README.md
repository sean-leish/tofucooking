# Welcome to tofucooking.net!

Tofucooking.net is a vegetarian cooking blog that I have created from scratch (both the recipes, and the code!)

With having a plethora of passions and hobbies in my life, cooking and software development are the two that stand out the most. I figured this would be an engaging personal project to combine them!

This is my introduction to front end development, as well as finally hardening up and creating a log of the various recipes that I've made over the years (for myself, and others to refer to and enjoy!).

While being very simple structure with html and css, there are a lot of future plans for this project in making it more scalable and advanced.

This is going to be an ongoing project that is going to have a lot of updates, so I hope you enjoy and stay tuned for more to come!

# Future Plans

- [ ] Reach 5 recipes for each category

- [ ] Incorporate front-end framework rather than purely html and css

- [ ] Embed an ingredient search for users to use (they have (x) ingredients, what can they make with them?)

- [ ] Add a feedback page for users to submit their comments, questions, or concerns
      
- [ ] Host on personal server rather than purchasing from 3rd party
